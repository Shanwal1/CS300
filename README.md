# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course we analyzed data structures, their advantages, disadvantages, and speeds. We looked at Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees. The problem we were solving for was opening a file that has course information in it. We then had to load the data into C++ and be able to search, print, and remove data. For our final project, we chose the data structure that we felt had the most advantages. 
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Each data structure has advantages and disadvantages. It was important to look at processing speeds because the files that would be loaded and processed can be very large. I chose to work with Binary Search Trees because there were many benefits. It is the simplest code for me, and while the space complexity is the same as the other data structures we looked at, the search function is faster. 
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The biggest challenge was making sure that all of the functions in each of my programs worked each week. The way I went about troubleshooting this was only adjusting one thing and then compiling right away. This way I could hone in on where any issues might be. It also made it faster to find mistakes while programming. 
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I am now able to open files and sort the information in them in multiple ways. I have a good foundation on collecting data and now I can build upon that for future projects. 
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focused on trying to make my programs as simple as possible. There were many functions in all of them so I felt like finding the simplest and cleanest way to write something was very important. That way it could easily be built upon or fixed. Also, in the future I can open any of them up and still understand what is written.
